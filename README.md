## About me

As a Data Analyst, I like solving problems from a strategic perspective, all solutions should be beneficial for clients and businesses and I have a passion for accurate work and attention to detail.
Before my Data Analytics career change, I was a Travel Consultant and later, a Statistitian in a Digital Marketing Agency where I discovered my passion for analyzing and manipulating data. I left that role with a strong ability to identify & manage different needs, solve complex problems, evaluate solutions and work with multiple deadlines.
I have been living abroad in different countries for 5 years which helped me to improve my ability to be receptive and flexible to different ideas, perspectives, and changing demands.
To begin my career change, I completed Juno Collegeâ€™s Intro to DA Course and now I'm at Juno Collegeâ€™s DA Bootcamp.
I'm excited to improve my skills in Python, SQL and Tableau and explore data in meaningful ways.

## Projects
### Game Player Retention analysis.

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/ProjectOne) 

This is a SQL project using Big Query for a database system.
In this project I analysed the 30-day player retention rate for a game company. 
Specific interest of this analysis is a correlation between player's spending and retention rate. 

### WEB Analysis for SF.gov

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/DataProtfolio/tree/main/Tableau%20Project) 

Created a dashboard using Tableau to visualize annual data from a SF.gov website. 
The goal of this project is to explore the correlation between bounce rate and average time spent on each web page.

### Beer Consumption Prediction

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/DataProtfolio/tree/main/Beer%20Consumption%20project) 

This is a linear regression problem: based on information about weather and beer consumption I predict how much beer will be consumed.
In this project I analysed how beer consumption dependends from weather condition in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

### Travel Insurance Prediction Project

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/DataProtfolio/tree/main/Capstone%20Project)

I created a customer demographic analysis in Tableau and build a classification model using Python that can predict if the customer will be interested in buying the travel insurance package.
