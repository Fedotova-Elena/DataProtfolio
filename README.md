This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and dashboards which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

### Retention rate analysis with SQL and Sheets.

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/ProjectOne) 

This is a SQL project using Big Query for a database system. In this project I analysed the rolling 30-day player retention rate for a mobile game company. Specific interest of this analysis is player's spending. 

### WEB Analysis for SF.gov

In this project I analysed average time spent on web pages in correlation to bounce rate.

### Beer Consumption Prediction

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/DataProtfolio/tree/main/Beer%20Consumption%20project) 

This is a regression problem: based on information about weather and beer consumption we predict how much beer will be consumed.
In this project I analysed how beer consumption dependends from weather condition in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

### Travel Insurance Prediction Project

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/DataProtfolio/tree/main/Capstone%20Project)

The companyâ€™s current travel insurance package does not include coverage for COVID related trip cancellation or medical expenses. Offering a new type of insurance could be a major differentiator for clients when they book a trip and a way to stay relevant in the post-pandemic marketplace.  But before changing the insurance policy the company wants to know which customers would be interested in buying a new insurance package and it's customer demographics.
