This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and dashboards which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

### Retention rate analysis with SQL and Sheets.

This is a SQL project using Big Query for a database system.
In this project I analysed the 30-day player retention rate for a game company. 
Specific interest of this analysis is there a correlation between player's spending and retention rate.

Created a dashboard using Tableau to visualize annual data from a SF.gov website. 
The goal of this project was to explore the correlation between bounce rate and average time spent on each web page.

### Beer Consumption Prediction

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/DataProtfolio/tree/main/Beer%20Consumption%20project) 

This is a linear regression problem: based on information about weather and beer consumption I predict how much beer will be consumed.
In this project I analysed how beer consumption dependends from weather condition in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

### Travel Insurance Prediction Project

[link](https://github.com/Fedotova-Elena/DataProtfolio/tree/main/Capstone%20Project)

I created a customer demographic analysis in Tableau and build a classification model using Python that can predict if the customer will be interested in buying the travel insurance package.
